I recently completed my computer science degree as of January 1st, 2024 and am currently looking for full-time positions as a software engineer! My contribution to this project was the entire front-end code: nearly 800 lines of JavaScript alone were written for this application as well as assisting in the development of our AI.</p>

I’m a CUNY Queens College student who has completed a Bachelors of Arts in Sociology and am currently completing a Bachelors of Arts in Computer Science and a minor in Data Analytics. My career goals align with working with data in meaningful ways, whether that is through data analysis, data science, or machine learning concepts and am actively looking for internships in these areas. Outside of school, I have been a coding instructor for over 2 years and I am currently part of the Breakthrough Tech in AI program. For this project, I worked on utilizing OpenAI's API to develop a custom AI.</p>

I'm also open to exploring other tech fields like AI, IT, data analysis, and UX/UI design. Currently, I'm actively seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and experience whether that is through internships, tech events, and additional courses. For this project, I designed a wireframe of the website’s interface using Figma and learned new technologies.</p>
