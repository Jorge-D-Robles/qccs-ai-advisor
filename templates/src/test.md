Given your academic history and preferences, Brian, I will outline a semester-by-semester plan for your remaining three semesters in the Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science program at Queens College. This plan will prioritize the average GPA of the course given by a specific professor, ensuring that you can manage the coursework effectively. You have mentioned a comfort with math and the ability to handle 3 Computer Science classes at a time. Additionally, you still need to complete 1 more Computer Science elective, MATH 143, and additional general education courses to satisfy graduation requirements.

### Semester Plan Overview

Given the courses you've completed and your preferences, the plan will include:
- **MATH 143**: To complete your Math requirements.
- **CSCI 313**: Data Structures, as you've completed its prerequisites.
- **One more CSCI elective**: Since you've mentioned completing 2 already and need 3 for a BA.
- **General Education Courses**: To fulfill the remaining requirements for graduation.

Let's proceed with the specific course recommendations for each semester, including professors with high average GPAs where possible.

### Semester 1

1. **CSCI 313: Data Structures** - Essential for your progression in the Computer Science program.
2. **CSCI Elective** - Based on the electives you haven't taken; I will recommend one that aligns with your interests and has high average GPA professors.
3. **MATH 143: Calculus III** - To complete your Math sequence.
4. **General Education Course** - Select based on your interests and remaining requirements.

### Semester 2 and 3

For the next two semesters, I will focus on:
- Completing the remaining Computer Science elective.
- Ensuring all required CSCI courses for the BA degree are completed.
- Fulfilling the rest of your general education requirements.

Given the courses you've completed and the typical offerings at Queens College, let's identify the specific courses and professors for Semester 1, then outline a plan for Semesters 2 and 3 based on the elective options available and general education needs.

I'll now select the optimal courses and professors for Semester 1 based on available data, including CSCI 313, a CSCI elective, MATH 143, and a recommendation for a general education course.

Based on the courses you've completed and your remaining requirements for a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science, here is a detailed plan for your next three semesters at Queens College. This plan takes into account your comfort with math, your ability to handle 3 Computer Science classes at a time, and your preference to prioritize courses with higher average GPAs given by specific professors.

### Semester 1
- **CSCI 313: Data Structures with Professor Tao, X** - A foundational course crucial for further CS studies.
- **CSCI 381: Special Topics in Comp Sci with Professor Roday, R** - An elective that offers you an opportunity to explore new areas in Computer Science with a high average GPA of 3.700.
- **General Education Course** - Choose a course that aligns with your remaining general education requirements. Given your load with CS courses, consider a course that is known to be engaging yet manageable.
- **MATH 143: Calculus III** - Complete your Calculus sequence. Since specific professor recommendations are not available from the provided data, I recommend consulting current course listings or departmental advice for a professor with a strong teaching record and higher GPA outcomes.

### Semester 2
- **CSCI 323: Design & Analysis of Algorithms with Professor Kahrobaei, D** - This course is critical for understanding the theoretical foundations of Computer Science and algorithm efficiency, with Professor Kahrobaei offering a high average GPA of 3.693, making it a solid choice for your final CSCI elective.
- **2 General Education Courses** - To continue making progress towards your graduation requirements, select courses from areas you have yet to fulfill. Aim for courses with a reputation for contributing positively to students' GPAs and enriching your overall academic experience.

### Semester 3
- **Finalize any remaining General Education Requirements** - Depending on your progress and previous course selections, use this semester to complete any outstanding general education courses. This can help balance your workload, especially if you're tackling more challenging CS courses.
- **Consider an Internship or Independent Study** - If your curriculum allows, and you've met all your major requirements, an internship or independent study in Computer Science can provide valuable hands-on experience and potentially count towards elective credits.

This plan balances your course load across the remaining semesters, aligning with your academic strengths and graduation timeline. It's important to verify each course's availability and any potential changes in professors or course offerings each semester. Additionally, continue consulting with your academic advisor to tailor this plan to any new interests or academic goals that arise.
